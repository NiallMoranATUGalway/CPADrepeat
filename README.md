# CPADrepeat
14/07/2025
This is my CPAD repeat project so far. I have chosen the 'Countdown' game with just the letters. I so far have a basic UI, and code behind the UI. I have implemented the sound, and I can read in 'dictionary.txt' locally but I cannot get the file download working.

I have removed the 'start game' button and replaced it with 'vowel' and 'consonant' buttons, and added their respective distribution rates. There is lots of bugs in this version and no repeat method but this will be amended in the future
